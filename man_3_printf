Example
To print the result of basic mathematical operations prepended by signs and 
all numbers printed with a minimum precision of two digits:


#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
	int a = 1, b = 2, c = a + b;
	int d = 10, e = 20, f = d - e;

	printf("%.2d + %.2d = %+.2d\n", a, b, c);
	printf("%d - %d = %+d\n", d, e, f);

	return 0;
}
